# Magnetic Trap Purification

Magnetic Trap Purification (MTP) is a novel twist on a tried and true purification methodolgy. By replacing antiquated magnetic stands with a magnetic construction that reaches >12,000 surface gauss, magnetic particles from a large volume resevoir can be flowed through a magnet trap. Enabling researchers to achieve a cleaner purification in a fraction of the time. Also, did I mention the platform is open-source? Ensuring modifications and improvements will continue to be avalable to researchers for the rest of time.
